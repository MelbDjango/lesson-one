## Homework Checklist

- [x] [Fork this repository][gh-fork]
- [x] Clone the repo to your own machine
- [x] Create a virtualenv for our MelbDjango School project
- [x] Install our requirements and use `python manage.py runserver` to test the application
- [x] Update the view we created in class to accept a `name` GET parameter and say hello to that person.
      You'll need to access the [request.GET][dj-request-response] object.
- [x] A step further - Add a `<form>` and `<input>` to let the user submit the name to be displayed

You'll need to be familiar with HTML and forms to do the last step above – check out the [MDN Introduction to HTML][mdn-html]
to understand the basics.

When you've completed some or all of the homework please make a [Pull Request][gh-pr] against this repository. If you submit
your work before Wednesday evening we'll give you feedback before the next class.

If you'd like help, make a Pull Request with your incomplete work and ask a question to @darrenfrenkel, @sesh or
